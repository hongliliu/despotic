DESPOTIC was primarily written by `Mark Krumholz
<http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/>`_, but it contains or relies on
the contributions of a number of others.

* Desika Narayanan has done more than anyone else to field test the
  code and discover bugs.
* DESPOTIC grew out of a code initially written in collaboration with
  Todd Thompson
* Adam Ginsburg provided useful advice and aided in early testing.
* Floris van der Tak has assisted in field testing the code, and
  helped improve the quality of the documentation.
* DESPOTIC would not be possible without the `Leiden Atomic and
  Molecular Database <http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/>`_,
  which is maintained by Floris van der Tak, Ewine van Dishoeck, and
  John Black, and which was initially established by Feredic Sch√∂ier
  
Mark Krumholz's work writing DESPOTIC was funded in part by the US
